    question: "What is TekGlove?",
    answer:
      "TekGlove is a wearable technology platform powered by the Smart Dorsal Sensor. It captures and interprets hand data across a family of connected gloves designed for health, movement, computing, recovery, defence, and industry.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does TekGlove focus on the hand?",
    answer:
      "The hand is a rich source of movement, grip, gesture, position, touch, and physical-response data. It also allows TekGlove to sense, respond, and connect without interrupting the task at hand.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Smart Dorsal Sensor?",
    answer:
      "The Smart Dorsal Sensor is the shared intelligence layer positioned on the back of the hand. It supports sensing, connectivity, gesture recognition, haptic feedback, and data processing across the TekGlove ecosystem.",
  },
