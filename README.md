# TekGlove

TekGlove is a wearable hand-data platform built around the Smart Dorsal Sensor. The website introduces a six-product ecosystem, with Kradle, Kinetik, and Kursor as its three current focus products across maternal health, movement and performance, and human-computer interaction.

## Technology

- Next.js 16 with the App Router
- React 19 and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Motion for interface animation
- Lucide and React Icons
- Bun for dependency management

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available commands

```bash
bun run dev        # Start the local development server
bun run lint       # Run ESLint
bun run typecheck  # Check TypeScript
bun run format     # Format the project with Prettier
bun run format:check # Verify project formatting
bun run build      # Create a production build
bun run check      # Run lint, type checking, and the production build
bun run start      # Serve the production build
```

## Project structure

```text
app/       Next.js routes, metadata, global styles, and app composition
content/   Static product, navigation, and company content
features/  Page-level features and their private components
shared/    Reusable layout, UI, and motion utilities
public/    Images and icons served by Next.js
```

Route files remain thin and delegate page implementation to `features/`. Shared modules must not import from routes or features. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete dependency rules.

## Routes

- `/` introduces the platform and product ecosystem
- `/about` explains the origin of TekGlove and why the hand matters
- `/product` presents the complete TekGlove product family
- `/product/kradle` introduces the maternal and health monitoring glove
- `/product/kursor` introduces the human-computer interaction glove
- `/waitlist` provides the early-access entry point

## Notes

- `global.d.ts` is intentionally retained to prevent CSS import type errors in the root layout.
- The splash screen is session-aware and respects reduced-motion preferences.
- Completed implementation plans are kept locally under `plans/` and ignored by Git.

## Production

Run `bun run check` before deploying. The application is configured as a statically rendered Next.js site and can be deployed to Vercel or another compatible host.
